# FlashCard-React-Crud-App
This will be a flash card app with a crud system where user can create decks and cards to study a subject. I normally use anki for my japanese study but I wanted to develope my own that I can have more control over how I want to study my cards.

## Planned tech to use
React Firebase Css or UI package

## Ideas
card flip with added images and sound To create multiple field on a card if it's needed to explained the cards meaning

example* Japanese can be spelt different ways depending on your kanji used you may need multiple filed to explain each reading.

## Functions
Log in Log out Create card Read card Update card Delete card Sort shuffle filter shuffle Stats on cards

### Pages Layout Ideas
///page 1

there will be two sample decks to try out without creating an account

////page 2

the card will be center of the screen with a button to flip the card or they can flip the card on clip

when the card flip it will show basis info and a button to show more information

////page 3
